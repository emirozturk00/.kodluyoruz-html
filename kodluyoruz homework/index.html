        <h2>Top Questions</h2>
        <h3>Why was Kemal Atatürk important?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Kemal Atatürk</b> was founder and first president of the <strong>Republic of Turkiye,</strong><br>
                having galvanized the Turkish people after the defeat of the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> in <b>World War I.</b><br>
                He implemented an ambitious <strong>program of modernization</strong> and broadly transformed the legal and social systems of Turkish life.
            </p>
        <h3>How was Kemal Educated?</h3>
            <p>
                He went to the <strong>Neighborhood School, Şemsi Efendi School, Thessaloniki Civil High School, Thessaloniki Military High School, <br>
                Thessaloniki Military High School, the Military Academy and the War Academy,</strong> respectively. <br> 
                While he was studying at the Military High School in 1893, he was named <b>Mustafa Kemal</b> by adding <strong>"Kemal"</strong> 
                to his name by his mathematics teacher.
            </p>
        <h3>How did Kemal Atatürk come to power?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Kemal Atatürk</b> became a <strong>national hero</strong> after turning back the <strong>Allies</strong> at <strong>Gallipoli</strong> during <strong>World War I.</strong> <br>
                Still, the <strong>Ottomans</strong> were defeated. To prevent partition of <strong>Anatolia</strong>, he led a rebellion against the <strong>sultanate.</strong> <br>
                In <strong>1923</strong> the sovereignty of the <strong>Turkish Republic</strong> was internationally recognized with the <b>Treaty of Lausanne</b>. <br>
                <b>Atatürk</b> became its <strong>first president.</strong>
            </p>
        <h3>What was Kemal Atatürk’s legacy?</h3>    
            <p>
                Aside from being the founder of modern <strong>Turkiye</strong>, <strong>Kemal Atatürk</strong> laid the groundwork for <strong>Turkey’s state ideology,</strong> <br>
                known as <strong>Kemalism.</strong> Its <strong>principles</strong> are <strong>republicanism, nationalism, populism, statism (state-controlled economic development), <br>
                secularism, and revolution (continual change in state and society),</strong> which were enshrined in the <strong>Turkish constitution in 1937.</strong>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Kemal Atatürk, (Turkish: “Kemal, Father of Turks”)</strong> original name <strong>Mustafa Kemal,</strong> also called <strong>Mustafa Kemal Paşa,</strong>
                <strong>(born 1881, Salonika [now Thessaloníki], Greece—died November 10, 1938, Istanbul, Turkey),</strong><br> <strong>soldier, statesman, and reformer</strong>
                who was the <strong>founder</strong> and <strong>first president (1923–38)</strong> of the <strong>Republic of Turkiye</strong>. 
                He modernized the country's legal and educational systems and encouraged the adoption of a European <br> way of life, 
                with <strong>Turkish written in the Latin alphabet</strong> and with citizens adopting European-style names.
                <strong>One of the great figures of the 20th century, Atatürk</strong> rescued the surviving <strong>Turkish</strong> remnant of the defeated <br> <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>
                at the end of <strong>World War I.</strong> He galvanized his people against invading <strong>Greek forces</strong> who sought to impose the <strong>Allied</strong> will upon 
                the <strong>war-weary Turks</strong> and repulsed aggression by <strong>British, French, and <br> Italian troops.</strong> Through these struggles, 
                he <strong>founded</strong> the <strong>modern Republic of Turkiye</strong>, for which he is still revved by the <strong>Turks</strong>. He succeeded in restoring to his people
                <strong>pride in their Turkishness,</strong> coupled with a new <br> sense of accomplishment as their nation was brought into the <strong>modern world.</strong>
                Over the next two decades, <strong>Atatürk</strong> created a <strong>modern state</strong> that would grow under his successors into a <strong>viable democracy.</strong> <br>

        <h2>Early life and education</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Atatürk</b> was born in <strong>1881</strong> in <strong>Salonika,</strong> then a thriving port of the <strong>Ottoman Empire,</strong> and was given the name <strong>Mustafa.</strong>
                His father, <strong>Ali Riza,</strong> had been a <strong>lieutenant</strong> in a local militia unit during the <strong>Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78,</strong> <br> 
                indicating that his origins were within the <b>Ottoman</b> ruling class, if only marginally. Mustafa's mother, <strong>Zübeyde Hanım,</strong> 
                came from a farming community west of Salonika. <b>Ali Riza</b> died when <strong>Mustafa</strong> was <strong>seven years</strong> old, <br> but he nevertheless 
                had a significant influence on the development of his son 's personality. At <strong>Mustafa's</strong> birth, <b>Ali Riza</b> hung his sword
                over his son 's cradle, dedicating him to <strong>military service.</strong> Most important, <strong>Ali Riza</strong> <br> saw to it that his son’s earliest
                education was carried out in a modern secular school, rather than in the religious school <b>Zübeyde Hanım</b> would have preferred.
                In this way <strong>Ali Riza</strong> set his son on the path of <strong>modernization.</strong> <br> This was something for which <strong>Mustafa</strong> always felt indebted to his <strong>father.</strong>

        <h2>Military Career</h2>
            <p>
                Mustafa Kemal’s career almost ended soon after his graduation when it was discovered that he and several friends were meeting
                to read about and discuss political abuses within the empire. A government spy infiltrated their group and informed on them.
                A cloud of suspicion hung over their heads that was not to be lifted for years. The group was broken up and its members 
                assigned to remote areas of the empire. Mustafa Kemal and Ali Fuat were sent to the Fifth Army in Damascus, 
                where Mustafa Kemal was angered by the way corrupt officials were treating the local people. Becoming involved again 
                in antigovernment activities, he helped found a short-lived secret group called the Society for Fatherland and Freedom.</p>,

            <p>
                Nevertheless, in September 1907 Mustafa Kemal was declared loyal and reassigned to Salonika, which was awash with subversive activity. 
                He joined the dominant antigovernment group, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which had ties to the nationalist and reformist
                Young Turk movement. In July 1908 an insurrection broke out in Macedonia. The sultan was forced to reinstate the constitution of 1876,
                which limited his powers and reestablished a representative government. The hero of this “Young Turk Revolution” was Enver (Enver Paşa), 
                who later became Mustafa Kemal’s greatest rival; the two men came to dislike each other thoroughly. In 1909 two elements within the 
                revolutionary movement came to the fore. One group favoured decentralization, with harmony and cooperation between the Muslims and the 
                non-Muslims. The other, headed by the CUP, advocated centralization and Turkish control. An insurrection spearheaded by reactionary 
                troops broke out on the night of April 12–13, 1909. The revolution that had restored the constitution in 1908 was in danger. Military   
                officers and troops from Salonika, among whom Enver played a leading role, marched on Istanbul. They arrived at the capital on April 23, 
                and by the next day they had the situation well in hand. The CUP took control and forced Abdülhamid II to abdicate.

            <p>
                Enver was thus in the ascendancy. Mustafa Kemal felt that the military, having gained its political ends, should refrain from interfering
                 in politics. He urged those officers who wanted political careers to resign their commissions. This served only to increase the hostility
                 of Enver and other CUP leaders toward him. Mustafa Kemal turned his attention from politics to military matters. He translated German 
                 infantry training manuals into Turkish. From his staff position he criticized the state of the army’s training. His reputation among 
                 serious military officers was growing. This activity also brought him into contact with many of the rising young officers. A feeling of 
                 mutual respect developed between Mustafa Kemal and some of these officers, who were later to flock to his support in the creation of the 
                 Turkish nation. The CUP, however, was fed up with him, and he was transferred to field command and then sent to observe French army 
                 maneuvers in Picardy. Although consistently denied promotion, Mustafa Kemal did not lose faith in himself. In late 1911 the Italians 
                 attacked Libya, then an Ottoman province, and Mustafa Kemal went there immediately to fight. Malaria and trouble with his eyes required 
                 him to leave the front for treatment in Vienna. In October 1912, while Mustafa Kemal was in Vienna, the First Balkan War broke out. He 
                 was assigned to the defense of the Gallipoli Peninsula, an area of strategic importance with respect to the Dardanelles. Within two months
                 the Ottoman Empire lost most of its territory in Europe, including Monastir and Salonika, places for which Mustafa Kemal had special affection.
                 Among the refugees who poured into Istanbul were his mother, sister, and stepfather. The Second Balkan War, of short duration (June–July 1913),
                 saw the Ottomans regain part of their lost territory. Relations were renewed with Bulgaria. Mustafa Kemal’s former schoolmate Ali Fethi was 
                 named ambassador, and Mustafa Kemal accompanied him to Sofia as military attaché. There he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

            <p>
                Mustafa Kemal complained of Enver’s close ties to Germany and predicted German defeat in an international conflict. Once World War I broke out, 
                however, and the Ottoman Empire entered on the side of the Central Powers, he sought a military command. Enver made him cool his heels in Sofia 
                but finally gave him command of the 19th Division, which was being organized in the Gallipoli Peninsula. It was here that the Allies attempted 
                their ill-fated landings, giving Mustafa Kemal the opportunity to throw them back and thwart their attempt to force the Dardanelles (February 1915–January 1916). 
                During the battle, Mustafa Kemal was hit by a piece of shrapnel, which lodged in the watch he carried in his breast pocket and thus failed to 
                cause him serious injury. His success at Gallipoli thrust Mustafa Kemal onto the world scene. He was hailed as the “Saviour of Istanbul” and was 
                promoted to colonel on June 1, 1915. In 1916 Mustafa Kemal was assigned to the Russian front and promoted to general, acquiring the title of pasha. 
                He was the only Turkish general to win any victories over the Russians on the Eastern Front. Later that year, he took over the command of the Second 
                Army in southeastern Anatolia. There he met Colonel İsmet (İnönü), who would become his closest ally in building the Turkish republic.

             <p>
                The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in March 1917 made Mustafa Kemal available for service in the Ottoman provinces of Syria and Iraq, on which 
                the British were advancing from their base in Egypt. He was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army in Syria, but he was appalled by the sad 
                state of the army. Resigning his post, he returned without permission to Istanbul. He was placed on leave for three months and then assigned to 
                accompany Crown Prince Mehmed Vahideddin on a state visit to Germany. On his return to Istanbul, Mustafa Kemal fell ill with kidney problems, most 
                probably related to gonorrhea, which it is believed he had contracted earlier. (His physical problems would later require him to have a personal 
                physician in constant attendance throughout his years as president of the Turkish republic.) He went to Vienna for treatment and then to Carlsbad 
                to recuperate. While he was in Carlsbad, Sultan Mehmed V died, and Vahideddin assumed the throne as Mehmed VI. Mustafa Kemal was recalled to 
                Istanbul in June 1918.

             <p>
                Through Enver’s machinations, the sultan assigned Mustafa Kemal to command the collapsing Ottoman forces in Syria. He found the situation there worse 
                than he had imagined and withdrew northward to save the lives of as many of his soldiers as possible. Fighting was halted by the Armistice of Mudros (October 30, 1918).
                Shortly afterward, Enver and other leaders of the CUP fled to Germany, leaving the sultan to lead the government. To ensure the continuation of his rule, 
                Mehmed VI was willing to cooperate with the Allies, who assumed control of the government.

        <h2>The nationalist movement and the war for independence</h2>
            <p>
                The Allies did not wait for a peace treaty to begin claiming Ottoman territory. Early in December 1918, Allied troops occupied sections of Istanbul 
                and set up an Allied military administration. On February 8, 1919, the French general Franchet d’Espèrey entered the city in a spectacle compared 
                to the entrance of Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453—but this time signifying that Ottoman sovereignty over the imperial city was over. The Allies made 
                plans to incorporate the provinces of eastern Anatolia into an independent Armenian state. French troops advanced into Cilicia in the southeast. 
                Greece and Italy put forward competing claims for southwestern Anatolia. The Italians occupied Marmaris, Antalya, and Burdur, and on May 15, 1919, 
                Greek troops landed at Izmir and began a drive into the interior of Anatolia, killing Turkish inhabitants and ravaging the countryside. 
                Allied statesmen seemed to be abandoning Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points in favour of the old imperialist views set down in the secret treaties 
                and contained in their own secret ambitions.
