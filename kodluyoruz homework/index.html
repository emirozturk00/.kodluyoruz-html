        <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Kemal Atatürk, (Turkish: “Kemal, Father of Turks”)</strong> original name <strong>Mustafa Kemal,</strong> also called <strong>Mustafa Kemal Paşa,</strong>
                <strong>(born 1881, Salonika [now Thessaloníki], Greece—died November 10, 1938, Istanbul, Turkey),</strong><br> <strong>soldier, statesman, and reformer</strong>
                who was the <strong>founder</strong> and <strong>first president (1923–38)</strong> of the <strong>Republic of Turkiye</strong>. 
                He modernized the country's legal and educational systems and encouraged the adoption of a European <br> way of life, 
                with <strong>Turkish written in the Latin alphabet</strong> and with citizens adopting European-style names.
                <strong>One of the great figures of the 20th century, Atatürk</strong> rescued the surviving <strong>Turkish</strong> remnant of the defeated <br> <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong>
                at the end of <strong>World War I.</strong> He galvanized his people against invading <strong>Greek forces</strong> who sought to impose the <strong>Allied</strong> will upon 
                the <strong>war-weary Turks</strong> and repulsed aggression by <strong>British, French, and <br> Italian troops.</strong> Through these struggles, 
                he <strong>founded</strong> the <strong>modern Republic of Turkiye</strong>, for which he is still revved by the <strong>Turks</strong>. He succeeded in restoring to his people
                <strong>pride in their Turkishness,</strong> coupled with a new <br> sense of accomplishment as their nation was brought into the <strong>modern world.</strong>
                Over the next two decades, <strong>Atatürk</strong> created a <strong>modern state</strong> that would grow under his successors into a <strong>viable democracy.</strong> <br>

        <h2>Early life and education</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Atatürk</b> was born in <strong>1881</strong> in <strong>Salonika,</strong> then a thriving port of the <strong>Ottoman Empire,</strong> and was given the name <strong>Mustafa.</strong>
                His father, <strong>Ali Riza,</strong> had been a <strong>lieutenant</strong> in a local militia unit during the <strong>Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78,</strong> <br> 
                indicating that his origins were within the <b>Ottoman</b> ruling class, if only marginally. Mustafa's mother, <strong>Zübeyde Hanım,</strong> 
                came from a farming community west of Salonika. <b>Ali Riza</b> died when <strong>Mustafa</strong> was <strong>seven years</strong> old, <br> but he nevertheless 
                had a significant influence on the development of his son 's personality. At <strong>Mustafa's</strong> birth, <b>Ali Riza</b> hung his sword
                over his son 's cradle, dedicating him to <strong>military service.</strong> Most important, <strong>Ali Riza</strong> <br> saw to it that his son’s earliest
                education was carried out in a modern secular school, rather than in the religious school <b>Zübeyde Hanım</b> would have preferred.
                In this way <strong>Ali Riza</strong> set his son on the path of <strong>modernization.</strong> <br> This was something for which <strong>Mustafa</strong> always felt indebted to his <strong>father.</strong>

        <h2>Military Career</h2>
            <p>
                Mustafa Kemal’s career almost ended soon after his graduation when it was discovered that he and several friends were meeting
                to read about and discuss political abuses within the empire. A government spy infiltrated their group and informed on them.
                A cloud of suspicion hung over their heads that was not to be lifted for years. The group was broken up and its members 
                assigned to remote areas of the empire. Mustafa Kemal and Ali Fuat were sent to the Fifth Army in Damascus, 
                where Mustafa Kemal was angered by the way corrupt officials were treating the local people. Becoming involved again 
                in antigovernment activities, he helped found a short-lived secret group called the Society for Fatherland and Freedom.</p>,
